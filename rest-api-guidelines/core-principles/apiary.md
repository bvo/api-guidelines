# API Design Platform

1. [Akwatype](https://akwatype.io) is the primary platform supporting [API first approach](../../general-guidelines/api-first.md). Akwatype **MUST** be used during API Design.
2. Every API description **MUST** be generated by [Akwatype](https://akwatype.io) .
3. Akwatype **MUST** be the **single source of truth** to learn about existing APIs within the organization.
