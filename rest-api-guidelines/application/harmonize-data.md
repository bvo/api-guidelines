# Corporate Data Model

The design of application data model **MUST** consider the application use cases, as well as the upstream and downstream systems, use cases.

Different names for entities and attributes **MAY** be used **ONLY** if the **CDM** is not including them. If a different name is introduced then it **MUST** be included in the **CDM**.

The consistency of the names of entities and attributes across the whole application **MUST** be maintained.
